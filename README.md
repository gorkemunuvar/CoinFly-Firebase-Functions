# CoinFly-Firebase-Functions

A small group of Fireabse serverless functions to handle coin alarms server side logic for a coin tracker app.

It performs CRUD operations for coin alarms as well as checking users' alarms int firestore and sending a push notification to the user's device.

Basically CoinFly looks like this but it is not open source:
